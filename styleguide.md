# Guidelines

Developers will be reading your documents to learn .NET core, and to use it in their regular work.
Your goal is to create useful documentation that helps the reader on their journey. Our guidelines
help with that. Our style guide contains four recommendations:
- [Use a Conversational Tone](#use-a-conversational-tone)
- Write in 2nd Person
- Use an Active Voice
- Target a 5th Grade Reading Level

You will see examples of each of these as you read this style guide. I've written this guide
following our guidelines to provide examples for you to follow as you build documentation
for .NET core. I also provide contrasting samples so you can see what articles look like
when you don't follow our guidelines.

# Details on each guideline

## Use a Conversational Tone
We want our documentation to have a conversational tone. YOu should feel as though you
are having a conversation with the author as you read any of our tutorials or explanations.
Your experience as a reader should be informal, conversational, and informative. You should
feel as though you are listening to the author explain the concepts to you.

Contrast that with reading more academic treatments of technical topics. Those
resources are very useful, but authors have written those artices in a very different
style than our documentation. One gets a very different flavor from reading those third
person, academic style writings. When one reads an academic journal, one finds a very
different tone and a very different style of writing. The articles 

The first paragraph above follows our recommendation conversational style. The second
is a more academic style. You should be able to see the difference immediately. 

## 2nd person

You should write your articles as though you are writing directly to the reader. You
should use second person often (like I just have in these two sentences). 2nd person doesn't
always mean using the word 'you'. Write directly to the reader. Write imperative sentences.
Tell what you want readers to learn.

An author could also choose to write in 3rd person. In that model, an author must find some
pronoun or noun to use when referring to the reader. A reader might often find this 3rd
person style less engaging and less enjoyable to read.

The first paragrah follows our recommended style. The second uses 3rd person. Pleas write
in second person. You probably found that much easier to read.

## active voice

Write your articles in active voice. Active voice means that the subject of the sentence performs
the action (verb) of that sentence. It contrasts with passive voice, where the sentence is arranged
such that the subject of the sentence is acted upon. Constrast these two examples:

>The compiler transformed by source code into an executable.

>The source code was transformed into an executable by the compiler.

The first sentence uses active voice. The second sentenace was written in passive voice.
(Those two sentences provide another example of each style).

We recommend active voice because it is more readable. Passive voice can be more difficult to read.

## 5th grade reading level

We provide this final guideline because many of our readers are not native English speakers. You are reaching
a world wide audience with your articles. Please take into account that they may not have the English
vocabulary you have.
