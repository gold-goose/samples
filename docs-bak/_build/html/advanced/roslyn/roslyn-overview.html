<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Traditionally, compilers are black boxes &#8211; source code goes in one end,
magic happens in the middle, and object files or assemblies come out the
other end. As compilers perform their magic, they build up deep
understanding of the code they are processing, but that knowledge is
unavailable to anyone but the compiler implementation wizards. The
information is promptly forgotten after the translated output is
produced.</p>
<p>For decades, this world view has served us well, but it is no longer
sufficient. Increasingly we rely on integrated development environment
(IDE) features such as IntelliSense, refactoring, intelligent rename,
“Find all references,” and “Go to definition” to increase our
productivity. We rely on code analysis tools to improve our code quality
and code generators to aid in application construction. As these tools
get smarter, they need access to more and more of the deep code
knowledge that only compilers possess. This is the core mission of the
.NET Compiler Platform (“Roslyn”): opening up the black boxes and
allowing tools and end users to share in the wealth of information
compilers have about our code. Instead of being opaque source-code-in
and object-code-out translators, through the .NET Compiler Platform
(“Roslyn”), compilers become platforms—APIs that you can use for code
related tasks in your tools and applications.</p>
<p>The transition to compilers as platforms dramatically lowers the barrier
to entry for creating code focused tools and applications. It creates
many opportunities for innovation in areas such as meta-programming,
code generation and transformation, interactive use of the C# and VB
languages, and embedding of C# and VB in domain specific languages.</p>
<p>The .NET Compiler Platform (“Roslyn”) SDK Preview includes the latest
drafts of new language object models for code generation, analysis, and
refactoring. We hope to include drafts of API support for scripting and
interactive use of C# and Visual Basic in a future preview. This
document provides a conceptual overview of the .NET Compiler Platform
(“Roslyn”). Further details can be found in the walkthroughs and samples
included in the SDK Preview.</p>

<h2>Exposing the Compiler APIs<a class="headerlink" href="#exposing-the-compiler-apis" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="compiler-pipeline-functional-areas">
<h3>Compiler Pipeline Functional Areas<a class="headerlink" href="#compiler-pipeline-functional-areas" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The .NET Compiler Platform (“Roslyn”) exposes the C# and Visual Basic
compiler’s code analysis to you as a consumer by providing an API layer
that mirrors a traditional compiler pipeline.</p>
<img alt="../../_images/compiler-pipeline.png" src="../../_images/compiler-pipeline.png" />
<p>Each phase of this pipeline is now a separate component. First the parse
phase, where source is tokenized and parsed into syntax that follows the
language grammar. Second the declaration phase, where declarations from
source and imported metadata are analyzed to form named symbols. Next
the bind phase, where identifiers in the code are matched to symbols.
Finally, the emit phase, where all the information built up by the
compiler is emitted as an assembly.</p>
<img alt="../../_images/compiler-pipeline-api.png" src="../../_images/compiler-pipeline-api.png" />
<p>Corresponding to each of those phases, an object model is surfaced that
allows access to the information at that phase. The parsing phase is
exposed as a syntax tree, the declaration phase as a hierarchical symbol
table, the binding phase as a model that exposes the result of the
compiler’s semantic analysis and the emit phase as an API that produces
IL byte codes.</p>
<img alt="../../_images/compiler-pipeline-lang-svc.png" src="../../_images/compiler-pipeline-lang-svc.png" />
<p>Each compiler combines these components together as a single end-to-end
whole.</p>
<p>To ensure that the public Compiler APIs are sufficient for building
world-class IDE features, the language services that will be used to
power the C# and VB experiences in Visual Studio vNext have been rebuilt
using them. For instance, the code outlining and formatting features use
the syntax trees, the Object Browser and navigation features use the
symbol table, refactorings and Go to Definition use the semantic model,
and Edit and Continue uses all of these, including the Emit API. These
experiences may be previewed on Visual Studio 2013 through the “Roslyn”
End-User Preview. This preview is required in order to build and test
applications build on top of the .NET Compiler Platform (“Roslyn”) SDK
meant for integration into Visual Studio though the .NET Compiler
Platform (“Roslyn”) APIs can be used in your own applications
independently of Visual Studio without requiring the End-User Preview.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="api-layers">
<h3>API Layers<a class="headerlink" href="#api-layers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The .NET Compiler Platform (“Roslyn”) consists of two main layers of
APIs – the Compiler APIs and Workspaces APIs.</p>
<img alt="../../_images/alex-api-layers.png" src="../../_images/alex-api-layers.png" />
<div class="section" id="compiler-apis">
<h4>Compiler APIs<a class="headerlink" href="#compiler-apis" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The compiler layer contains the object models that correspond with
information exposed at each phase of the compiler pipeline, both
syntactic and semantic. The compiler layer also contains an immutable
snapshot of a single invocation of a compiler, including assembly
references, compiler options, and source code files. There are two
distinct APIs that represent the C# language and the Visual Basic
language. These two APIs are similar in shape but tailored for
high fidelity to each individual language. This layer has no
dependencies on Visual Studio components.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="diagnostic-apis">
<h4>Diagnostic APIs<a class="headerlink" href="#diagnostic-apis" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>As part of their analysis the compiler may produce a set of diagnostics
covering everything from syntax, semantic, and definite assignment
errors to various warnings and informational diagnostics. The Compiler
API layer exposes diagnostics through an extensible API allowing for
user-defined analyzers to be plugged into a compilation and user-defined
diagnostics, such as those produced by tools like StyleCop or FxCop, to
be produced alongside compiler-defined diagnostics. Producing
diagnostics in this way has the benefit of integrating naturally with
tools such as MSBuild and Visual Studio which depend on diagnostics for
experiences such as halting a build based on policy and showing live
squiggles in the editor and suggesting code fixes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="scripting-apis">
<h4>Scripting APIs<a class="headerlink" href="#scripting-apis" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>As a part of the compiler layer, the team prototyped hosting/scripting
APIs for executing code snippets and accumulating a runtime execution
context. The REPL used these APIs, but neither the REPL nor the
Scripting APIs are part of the .NET Compiler Platform project currently.
The team is reviewing these designs before re-introducing these
components.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="workspaces-apis">
<h4>Workspaces APIs<a class="headerlink" href="#workspaces-apis" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The Workspaces layer contains the Workspace API, which is the starting
point for doing code analysis and refactoring over entire solutions. It
assists you in organizing all the information about the projects in a
solution into a single object model, offering you direct access to the
compiler layer object models without needing to parse files, configure
options or manage project to project dependencies.</p>
<p>In addition, the Workspaces layer surfaces a set of commonly used APIs
used when implementing code analysis and refactoring tools that function
within a host environment like the Visual Studio IDE, such as the Find
All References, Formatting, and Code Generation APIs.</p>
<p>This layer has no dependencies on Visual Studio components.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="working-with-syntax">
<h2>Working with Syntax<a class="headerlink" href="#working-with-syntax" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The most fundamental data structure exposed by the Compiler APIs is the
syntax tree. These trees represent the lexical and syntactic structure
of source code. They serve two important purposes:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>To allow tools - such as an IDE, add-ins, code analysis tools, and
refactorings - to see and process the syntactic structure of source
code in a user’s project.</li>
<li>To enable tools - such as refactorings and an IDE - to create,
modify, and rearrange source code in a natural manner without having
to use direct text edits. By creating and manipulating trees, tools can
easily create and rearrange source code.</li>
</ol>
<div class="section" id="syntax-trees">
<h3>Syntax Trees<a class="headerlink" href="#syntax-trees" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Syntax trees are the primary structure used for compilation, code
analysis, binding, refactoring, IDE features, and code generation. No
part of the source code is understood without it first being identified
and categorized into one of many well-known structural language
elements.</p>
<p>Syntax trees have three key attributes. The first attribute is that
syntax trees hold all the source information in full fidelity. This
means that the syntax tree contains every piece of information found in
the source text, every grammatical construct, every lexical token, and
everything else in between including whitespace, comments, and
preprocessor directives. For example, each literal mentioned in the
source is represented exactly as it was typed. The syntax trees also
represent errors in source code when the program is incomplete or
malformed, by representing skipped or missing tokens in the syntax tree.</p>
<p>This enables the second attribute of syntax trees. A syntax tree
obtained from the parser is completely round-trippable back to the text
it was parsed from. From any syntax node, it is possible to get the text
representation of the sub-tree rooted at that node. This means that
syntax trees can be used as a way to construct and edit source text. By
creating a tree you have by implication created the equivalent text, and
by editing a syntax tree, making a new tree out of changes to an
existing tree, you have effectively edited the text.</p>
<p>The third attribute of syntax trees is that they are immutable and
thread-safe. This means that after a tree is obtained, it is a snapshot
of the current state of the code, and never changes. This allows
multiple users to interact with the same syntax tree at the same time in
different threads without locking or duplication. Because the trees are
immutable and no modifications can be made directly to a tree, factory
methods help create and modify syntax trees by creating additional
snapshots of the tree. The trees are efficient in the way they reuse
underlying nodes, so the new version can be rebuilt fast and with little
extra memory.</p>
<p>A syntax tree is literally a tree data structure, where non-terminal
structural elements parent other elements. Each syntax tree is made up
of nodes, tokens, and trivia.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="syntax-nodes">
<h3>Syntax Nodes<a class="headerlink" href="#syntax-nodes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Syntax nodes are one of the primary elements of syntax trees. These
nodes represent syntactic constructs such as declarations, statements,
clauses, and expressions. Each category of syntax nodes is represented
by a separate class derived from SyntaxNode. The set of node classes is
not extensible.</p>
<p>All syntax nodes are non-terminal nodes in the syntax tree, which means
they always have other nodes and tokens as children. As a child of
another node, each node has a parent node that can be accessed through
the Parent property. Because nodes and trees are immutable, the parent
of a node never changes. The root of the tree has a null parent.</p>
<p>Each node has a ChildNodes method, which returns a list of child nodes
in sequential order based on its position in the source text. This list
does not contain tokens. Each node also has a collection of Descendant
methods - such as DescendantNodes, DescendantTokens, or DescendantTrivia
- that represent a list of all the nodes, tokens, or trivia that exist
in the sub-tree rooted by that node.</p>
<p>In addition, each syntax node subclass exposes all the same children
through strongly typed properties. For example, a BinaryExpressionSyntax
node class has three additional properties specific to binary operators:
Left, OperatorToken, and Right. The type of Left and Right is
ExpressionSyntax, and the type of OperatorToken is SyntaxToken.</p>
<p>Some syntax nodes have optional children. For example, an
IfStatementSyntax has an optional ElseClauseSyntax. If the child is not
present, the property returns null.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="syntax-tokens">
<h3>Syntax Tokens<a class="headerlink" href="#syntax-tokens" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Syntax tokens are the terminals of the language grammar, representing
the smallest syntactic fragments of the code. They are never parents of
other nodes or tokens. Syntax tokens consist of keywords, identifiers,
literals, and punctuation.</p>
<p>For efficiency purposes, the SyntaxToken type is a CLR value type.
Therefore, unlike syntax nodes, there is only one structure for all
kinds of tokens with a mix of properties that have meaning depending on
the kind of token that is being represented.</p>
<p>For example, an integer literal token represents a numeric value. In
addition to the raw source text the token spans, the literal token has a
Value property that tells you the exact decoded integer value. This
property is typed as Object because it may be one of many primitive
types.</p>
<p>The ValueText property tells you the same information as the Value
property; however this property is always typed as String. An identifier
in C# source text may include Unicode escape characters, yet the syntax
of the escape sequence itself is not considered part of the identifier
name. So although the raw text spanned by the token does include the
escape sequence, the ValueText property does not. Instead, it includes
the Unicode characters identified by the escape.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="syntax-trivia">
<h3>Syntax Trivia<a class="headerlink" href="#syntax-trivia" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Syntax trivia represent the parts of the source text that are largely
insignificant for normal understanding of the code, such as whitespace,
comments, and preprocessor directives.</p>
<p>Because trivia are not part of the normal language syntax and can appear
anywhere between any two tokens, they are not included in the syntax
tree as a child of a node. Yet, because they are important when
implementing a feature like refactoring and to maintain full fidelity
with the source text, they do exist as part of the syntax tree.</p>
<p>You can access trivia by inspecting a token’s LeadingTrivia or
TrailingTrivia collections. When source text is parsed, sequences of
trivia are associated with tokens. In general, a token owns any trivia
after it on the same line up to the next token. Any trivia after that
line is associated with the following token. The first token in the
source file gets all the initial trivia, and the last sequence of trivia
in the file is tacked onto the end-of-file token, which otherwise has
zero width.</p>
<p>Unlike syntax nodes and tokens, syntax trivia do not have parents. Yet,
because they are part of the tree and each is associated with a single
token, you may access the token it is associated with using the Token
property.</p>
<p>Like syntax tokens, trivia are value types. The single SyntaxTrivia type
is used to describe all kinds of trivia.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="spans">
<h3>Spans<a class="headerlink" href="#spans" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Each node, token, or trivia knows its position within the source text
and the number of characters it consists of. A text position is
represented as a 32-bit integer, which is a zero-based Unicode character
index. A TextSpan object is the beginning position and a count of
characters, both represented as integers. If TextSpan has a zero length,
it refers to a location between two characters.</p>
<p>Each node has two TextSpan properties: Span and FullSpan.</p>
<p>The Span property is the text span from the start of the first token in
the node’s sub-tree to the end of the last token. This span does not
include any leading or trailing trivia.</p>
<p>The FullSpan property is the text span that includes the node’s normal
span, plus the span of any leading or trailing trivia.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<div class="highlight-c#"><div class="highlight"><pre>      <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="p">&gt;</span> <span class="m">3</span><span class="p">)</span>
      <span class="p">{</span>
<span class="p">||</span>        <span class="c1">// this is bad</span>
          <span class="p">|</span><span class="k">throw</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">Exception</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Not right.&quot;</span><span class="p">);|</span>  <span class="c1">// better exception?||</span>
      <span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The statement node inside the block has a span indicated by the single
vertical bars (|). It includes the characters +throw new Exception(“Not
right.”);+. The full span is indicated by the double vertical bars
(||). It includes the same characters as the span and the characters
associated with the leading and trailing trivia.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="kinds">
<h3>Kinds<a class="headerlink" href="#kinds" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Each node, token, or trivia has a RawKind property, of type
System.Int32, that identifies the exact syntax element represented. This
value can be cast to a language-specific enumeration; each language, C#
or VB, has a single SyntaxKind enumeration that lists all the possible
nodes, tokens, and trivia elements in the grammar. This conversion can
be done automatically by accessing the CSharpSyntaxKind() or
VisualBasicSyntaxKind() extension methods.</p>
<p>The RawKind property allows for easy disambiguation of syntax node types
that share the same node class. For tokens and trivia, this property is
the only way to distinguish one type of element from another.</p>
<p>For example, a single BinaryExpressionSyntax class has Left,
OperatorToken, and Right as children. The Kind property distinguishes
whether it is an AddExpression, SubtractExpression, or
MultiplyExpression kind of syntax node.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="errors">
<h3>Errors<a class="headerlink" href="#errors" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Even when the source text contains syntax errors, a full syntax tree
that is round-trippable to the source is exposed. When the parser
encounters code that does not conform to the defined syntax of the
language, it uses one of two techniques to create a syntax tree.</p>
<p>First, if the parser expects a particular kind of token, but does not
find it, it may insert a missing token into the syntax tree in the
location that the token was expected. A missing token represents the
actual token that was expected, but it has an empty span, and its
IsMissing property returns true.</p>
<p>Second, the parser may skip tokens until it finds one where it can
continue parsing. In this case, the skipped tokens that were skipped are
attached as a trivia node with the kind SkippedTokens.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="working-with-semantics">
<h2>Working with Semantics<a class="headerlink" href="#working-with-semantics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Syntax trees represent the lexical and syntactic structure of source
code. Although this information alone is enough to describe all the
declarations and logic in the source, it is not enough information to
identify what is being referenced.</p>
<p>For example, many types, fields, methods, and local variables with the
same name may be spread throughout the source. Although each of these is
uniquely different, determining which one an identifier actually refers
to often requires a deep understanding of the language rules.</p>
<p>There are program elements represented in source code, and programs can
also refer to previously compiled libraries, packaged in assembly files.
Although no source code is available for assemblies and therefore no
syntax nodes or trees, programs can still refer to elements inside them.</p>
<p>In addition to a syntactic model of the source code, a semantic model
encapsulates the language rules, giving you an easy way to make these
distinctions.</p>
<div class="section" id="compilation">
<h3>Compilation<a class="headerlink" href="#compilation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A compilation is a representation of everything needed to compile a C#
or Visual Basic program, which includes all the assembly references,
compiler options, and source files.</p>
<p>Because all this information is in one place, the elements contained in
the source code can be described in more detail. The compilation
represents each declared type, member, or variable as a symbol. The
compilation contains a variety of methods that help you find and relate
the symbols that have either been declared in the source code or
imported as metadata from an assembly.</p>
<p>Similar to syntax trees, compilations are immutable. After you create a
compilation, it cannot be changed by you or anyone else you might be
sharing it with. However, you can create a new compilation from an
existing compilation, specifying a change as you do so. For example, you
might create a compilation that is the same in every way as an existing
compilation, except it may include an additional source file or assembly
reference.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="symbols">
<h3>Symbols<a class="headerlink" href="#symbols" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A symbol represents a distinct element declared by the source code or
imported from an assembly as metadata. Every namespace, type, method,
property, field, event, parameter, or local variable is represented by a
symbol.</p>
<p>A variety of methods and properties on the Compilation type help you
find symbols. For example, you can find a symbol for a declared type by
its common metadata name. You can also access the entire symbol table as
a tree of symbols rooted by the global namespace.</p>
<p>Symbols also contain additional information that the compiler determined
from the source or metadata, such as other referenced symbols. Each kind
of symbol is represented by a separate interface derived from ISymbol,
each with its own methods and properties detailing the information the
compiler has gathered. Many of these properties directly reference other
symbols. For example, the ReturnType property of the IMethodSymbol class
tells you the actual type symbol that the method declaration referenced.</p>
<p>Symbols present a common representation of namespaces, types, and
members, between source code and metadata. For example, a method that
was declared in source code and a method that was imported from metadata
are both represented by an IMethodSymbol with the same properties.</p>
<p>Symbols are similar in concept to the CLR type system as represented by
the System.Reflection API, yet they are richer in that they model more
than just types. Namespaces, local variables, and labels are all
symbols. In addition, symbols are a representation of language concepts,
not CLR concepts. There is a lot of overlap, but there are many
meaningful distinctions as well. For instance, an iterator method in C#
or Visual Basic is a single symbol. However, when the iterator method is
translated to CLR metadata, it is a type and multiple methods.</p>

<div class="section" id="semantic-model">
<h3>Semantic Model<a class="headerlink" href="#semantic-model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A semantic model represents all the semantic information for a single
source file. You can use it to discover the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The symbols referenced at a specific location in source.</li>
<li>The resultant type of any expression.</li>
<li>All diagnostics, which are errors and warnings.</li>
<li>How variables flow in and out of regions of source.</li>
<li>The answers to more speculative questions.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="working-with-a-workspace">
<h2>Working with a Workspace<a class="headerlink" href="#working-with-a-workspace" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Workspaces layer is the starting point for doing code analysis and
refactoring over entire solutions. Within this layer, the Workspace API
assists you in organizing all the information about the projects in a
solution into single object model, offering you direct access to
compiler layer object models like source text, syntax trees, semantic
models and compilations without needing to parse files, configure
options or manage inter-project dependencies.</p>
<p>Host environments, like an IDE, provide a workspace for you
corresponding to the open solution. It is also possible to use this
model outside of an IDE by simply loading a solution file.</p>
<div class="section" id="workspace">
<h3>Workspace<a class="headerlink" href="#workspace" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A workspace is an active representation of your solution as a collection
of projects, each with a collection of documents. A workspace is
typically tied to a host environment that is constantly changing as a
user types or manipulates properties.</p>
<p>The workspace provides access to the current model of the solution. When
a change in the host environment occurs, the workspace fires
corresponding events, and the CurrentSolution property is updated. For
example, when the user types in a text editor corresponding to one of
the source documents, the workspace uses an event to signal that the
overall model of the solution has changed and which document was
modified. You can then react to those changes by analyzing the new model
for correctness, highlighting areas of significance, or by making a
suggestion for a code change.</p>
<p>You can also create stand-alone workspaces that are disconnected from
the host environment or used in an application that has no host
environment.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="solutions-projects-documents">
<h3>Solutions, Projects, Documents<a class="headerlink" href="#solutions-projects-documents" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Although a workspace may change every time a key is pressed, you can
work with the model of the solution in isolation.</p>
<p>A solution is an immutable model of the projects and documents. This
means that the model can be shared without locking or duplication. After
you obtain a solution instance from the Workspace’s CurrentSolution
property, that instance will never change. However, like with syntax
trees and compilations, you can modify solutions by constructing new
instances based on existing solutions and specific changes. To get the
workspace to reflect your changes, you must explicitly apply the changed
solution back to the workspace.</p>
<p>A project is a part of the overall immutable solution model. It
represents all the source code documents, parse and compilation options,
and both assembly and project-to-project references. From a project, you
can access the corresponding compilation without needing to determine
project dependencies or parse any source files.</p>
<p>A document is also a part of the overall immutable solution model. A
document represents a single source file from which you can access the
text of the file, the syntax tree, and the semantic model.</p>
<p>The following diagram is a representation of how the Workspace relates
to the host environment, tools, and how edits are made.</p>

<h2>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The .NET Compiler Platform (“Roslyn”) exposes a set of Compiler APIs and
Workspaces APIs that provides rich information about your source code
and that has full fidelity with the C# and Visual Basic languages. The
transition to compilers as a platform dramatically lowers the barrier to
entry for creating code focused tools and applications. It creates many
opportunities for innovation in areas such as meta-programming, code
generation and transformation, interactive use of the C# and VB
languages, and embedding of C# and VB in domain specific languages.</p>
