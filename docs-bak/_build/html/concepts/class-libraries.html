<h1>.NET Class Libraries<a class="headerlink" href="#net-class-libraries" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Class libraries are the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)#Shared_libraries">shared
library</a>
concept for .NET. They enable you to componentize useful functionality
into modules that can be used by multiple applications. They can also be
used as a means of loading functionality that is not needed or not known
at application startup. Class libraries are described using the <a class="reference external" href="assembly*format.md">.NET
Assembly file format</a>.</p>
<p>There are three types of class libraries that you can use:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Platform*specific</strong> class libraries have access to all the APIs in
a given platform (e.g. .NET Framework, Xamarin iOS), but can only be
used by apps and libraries that target that platform.</li>
<li><strong>Portable</strong> class libraries have access to a subset of APIs, and can
be used by apps and libraries that target multiple platforms.</li>
<li><strong>.NET Core</strong> class libraries are a merger of the platform*specific
and portable library concept into a single model that provides the
best of both.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="platform-specific-class-libraries">
<h2>Platform*specific Class Libraries<a class="headerlink" href="#platform-specific-class-libraries" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Platform*specific libraries are bound to a single .NET platform (e.g.
.NET Framework on Windows) and can therefore take significant
dependencies on a known execution environment. Such an environment will
expose a known set of APIs (.NET and OS APIs) and will maintain and
expose expected state (e.g. Windows registry).</p>
<p>Developers who create plaform specific libraries can fully exploit the
underlying platform. The libraries will only ever run on that given
platform, making platform checks or other forms of conditional code
unnecessary (modulo single sourcing code for multiple platforms).</p>
<p>Platform*specific libraries have been the primary class library type for
the .NET Framework. Even as other .NET platforms emerged,
platform*specific libraries remained the dominant library type.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="portable-class-libraries">
<h2>Portable Class Libraries<a class="headerlink" href="#portable-class-libraries" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Portable libraries are supported on multiple .NET platforms. They can
still take dependencies on a known execution environment, however, the
environment is a synthetic one that is generated by the intersection of
a set of concrete .NET platforms. This means that exposed APIs and
platform assumptions are a subset of what would be available to a
platform*specific library.</p>
<p>You choose a platform configuration when you create a portable library.
These are the set of platforms that you need to support (e.g. .NET
Framework 4.5+, Windows Phone 8.0+). The more platforms you opt to
support, the fewer APIs and fewer platform assumptions you can make, the
lowest common denominator. This characteristic can be confusing at
first, since people often think &#8220;more is better&#8221;, but find that more
supported platforms results in fewer available APIs.</p>
<p>Many library developers have switched from producing multiple
platform*specific libraries from one source (using conditional
compilation directives) to portable libraries. There are <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.stephencleary.com/2012/11/portable*class*library*enlightenment.html">several
approaches</a>
for accessing platform*specific functionality within portable libraries,
with
<a class="reference external" href="http://log.paulbetts.org/the*bait*and*switch*pcl*trick/">bait*and*switch</a>
being the most widely accepted technique at this point.</p>
<div class="section" id="net-core-class-libraries">
<h3>.NET Core Class Libraries<a class="headerlink" href="#net-core-class-libraries" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>.NET Core libraries are a replacement of the platform*specific and
portable libraries concepts. They are platform*specific in the sense
that they expose all functionality from the underlying platform (no
synthetic platforms or platform intersections). They are portable in the
sense that they work on all supporting platforms.</p>
<p>.NET Core exposes a set of library <em>contracts</em>. .NET platforms must
support each contract fully or not at all. Each platform, therefore,
supports a set of .NET Core contracts. The corollary is that each .NET
Core class library is supported on the platforms that support it&#8217;s
contract dependencies.</p>
<p>.NET Core contracts do not expose the entire functionality of the .NET
Framework (nor is that a goal), however, they do expose many more APIs
than Portable Class Libraries. More APIs will be added over time.</p>
<p>The following platforms support .NET Core class libraries:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>.NET Core 5</li>
<li>ASP.NET 5</li>
<li>.NET Framework 4.5+</li>
<li>Windows Store Apps</li>
<li>Windows Phone 8+</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="mono-class-libraries">
<h3>Mono Class Libraries<a class="headerlink" href="#mono-class-libraries" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Class libraries are supported on Mono, including the three types of
libraries described above. Mono has often been seen (correctly) as a
cross*platform implementation of the Microsoft .NET Framework. In part,
this was because platform*specific .NET Framework libraries could run on
the Mono runtime without modification or re*compilation. This
characteristic was in place before the creation of portable class
libraries, so was an obvious choice to enable binary portability between
the .NET Framework and Mono (although it only worked in one direction).</p>
