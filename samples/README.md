# .NET Core Samples

The code samples here are simple, buildable projects which augment the .NET Core Documentation with demonstrative code snippets.  These samples are directly embedded into documentation.

If you wish to add a code sample:

1. Your sample **must be part of a buildable project**
2. Your sample **cannot be a Visual Studio Project**

	- We do not want Windows and Visual Studio to be a dependency for people building these on their own.

We will eventually have a CI system in place to build these projects.
