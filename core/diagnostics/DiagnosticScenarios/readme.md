# DiagnosticScenarios sample debug target

This sample is for the [diagnostics tutorials](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/diagnostics/tutorial/diagnostic-scenarios) in the .NET Core Guide.

The scenarios are implemented using a `webapi` target with methods that trigger undesirable behaviors for us to diagnose.

## Target methods

### Deadlock

http://localhost:5000/api/diagscenario/deadlock

This method will cause the target to hang and accumulate many threads.

### High CPU usage

http://localhost:5000/api/diagscenario/highcpu/{milliseconds}

The method will cause to target to heavily use the CPU for a duration specified by {milliseconds}.

### Memory leak

http://localhost:5000/api/diagscenario/memleak/{kb}

This method will cause the target to leak memory (amount specified by {kb}).

### Memory usage spike

http://localhost:5000/api/diagscenario/memspike/{seconds}

This method will cause intermittent memory spikes over the specified number of seconds. Memory will go from base line to spike and back to baseline several times.
