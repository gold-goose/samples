# Lines starting with '#' are comments.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# More details are here: https://help.github.com/articles/about-codeowners/

# The '*' pattern is global owners.
# Not adding in this PR, but I'd like to try adding a global owner set with the entire team.
# One interpretation of their docs is that global owners are added only if not removed
# by a more local rule.

# Order is important. The last matching pattern has the most precedence.
# So if a pull request only touches javascript files, only these owners
# will be requested to review.
